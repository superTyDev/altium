					for our data processing. If the legal basis is not mentioned in the
					data protection declaration, the following applies: The legal basis
					for obtaining consent is Art. 6 (1) lit. a and Art Answering inquiries

					measures, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation
					costs and the type, scope, circumstances and purposes of the
					processing as well as the different probability of occurrence and
					severity of the risk for the rights and freedoms of natural persons
					and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection
					appropriate to the risk.
				</p>

					integrity and availability of data by controlling physical access to
					the data, as well as access, input, transfer, securing availability
					and their separation. Furthermore, we have set up procedures that

					basis of legal permission (e.g. if the data is transmitted to third
					parties, as to payment service providers, pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1
					lit. b GDPR is required for the fulfillment of the contract), you have
					consented, a legal obligation provides for this or on the basis of our
					legitimate interests (e.g. when using agents, web hosts, etc.).

					so-called &quot;order processing contract&quot;, this is done on the
					basis of Art. 28 GDPR.

					basis of a legal obligation or on the basis of our legitimate
					interests. Subject to legal or contractual permissions, we only
					process or have the data processed in a third country if the special
					requirements of Art. 44 et seq. GDPR are met. This means that the

				<h4>Cookies and the right to object to direct advertising</h4>
				<p>
					&quot;Cookies&quot; are small files that are stored on users&apos;
					computers. Different information can be stored within the cookies. A
					cookie is primarily used to store information about a user (or the
					device on which the cookie is stored) during or after their visit to
					an online offer. Temporary cookies, or &quot;session cookies&quot; or
					&quot;transient cookies&quot;, are cookies that are deleted after a
					user leaves an online offer and closes his browser. In such a cookie,
					for example, the content of a shopping cart in an online shop or a
					login status can be saved. &quot;Permanent&quot; or
					&quot;persistent&quot; refers to cookies that remain stored even after
					the browser is closed. For example, the login status can be saved if
					users visit it after several days. The interests of the users can also
					be stored in such a cookie, which are used for range measurement or
					marketing purposes. &quot;Third-party cookies&quot; are cookies that
					are offered by providers other than the person responsible for
					operating the online offer (otherwise, if they are only their cookies,
					we speak of &quot;first-party cookies&quot;).
				</p>

				<p>
					We can use temporary and permanent cookies and explain this in our
					data protection declaration.
				</p>

				<p>
					If users do not want cookies to be stored on their computer, they are
					asked to deactivate the corresponding option in their browser&apos;s
					system settings. Saved cookies can be deleted in the system settings
					of the browser. The exclusion of cookies can lead to functional
					restrictions of this online offer.
				</p>

				<p>
					A general objection to the use of cookies for online marketing
					purposes can be raised for a large number of services, especially in
					the case of tracking, via the US website
					http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or the EU website
					http://www.youronlinechoices.com/be explained. Furthermore, the
					storage of cookies can be achieved by switching them off in the
					browser settings. Please note that in this case not all functions of
					this online offer can be used.
				</p>

				<h4>deletion of data</h4>
				<p>
					The data processed by us will be deleted or their processing
					restricted in accordance with Art. 17 and 18 GDPR. Unless expressly
					stated in this data protection declaration, the data stored by us will
					be deleted as soon as they are no longer required for their intended
					purpose and the deletion does not conflict with any statutory storage
					requirements. If the data is not deleted because it is required for
					other and legally permissible purposes, its processing will be
					restricted. This means that the data will be blocked and not processed
					for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be
					retained for commercial or tax reasons.
				</p>

				<p>
					According to legal requirements in Germany, storage takes place in
					particular for 10 years in accordance with Â§Â§ 147 Paragraph 1 AO, 257
					Paragraph 1 No. 1 and 4, Paragraph 4 HGB (books, records, management
					reports, accounting documents, trading books, relevant for taxation
					documents, etc.) and 6 years in accordance with Section 257 Paragraph
					1 Nos. 2 and 3, Paragraph 4 HGB (commercial letters).
				</p>

				<p>
					According to legal requirements in Austria, storage takes place in
					particular for 7 years in accordance with Â§ 132 Para. 1 BAO
					(accounting documents, receipts/invoices, accounts, receipts, business
					papers, list of income and expenses, etc.), for 22 years in connection
					with properties and for 10 years for documents related to
					electronically supplied services, telecommunications, radio and
					television services supplied to non-businesses in EU Member States and
					for which the Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) is used.
				</p>

				<h4>contact</h4>
				<p>
					When contacting us (e.g. via contact form, e-mail, telephone or via
					social media), the information provided by the user is used to process
					the contact request and to process it in accordance with Article 6 (1)
					b. (in the context of contractual/pre-contractual relationships), Art.
					6 Paragraph 1 lit. f. (other inquiries) GDPR processed get saved.
				</p>

				<p>
					We delete the requests if they are no longer necessary. We review
					necessity every two years; Furthermore, the statutory archiving
					obligations apply.
				</p>

				<h4>hosting and email delivery</h4>
				<p>
					The hosting services we use serve to provide the following services:
					infrastructure and platform services, computing capacity, storage
					space and database services, e-mail dispatch, security services and
					technical maintenance services that we use for the purpose of
					operating this online offer.
				</p>

				<p>
					In doing so, we or our hosting provider process inventory data,
					contact data, content data, contract data, usage data, meta and
					communication data from customers, interested parties and visitors to
					this online offer on the basis of our legitimate interests in making
					this online offer available efficiently and securely in accordance
					with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR in conjunction with Art. 28 GDPR
					(conclusion of order processing contract).
				</p>

				<h4>Collection of access data and log files</h4>
				<p>
					We, or our hosting provider, collect data about every access to the
					server on which this service is located (so-called server log files)
					on the basis of our legitimate interests within the meaning of Article
					6 Paragraph 1 lit. The access data includes the name of the accessed
					website, file, date and time of access, amount of data transferred,
					notification of successful access, browser type and version, the
					user&apos;s operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited
					page), IP address and the requesting provider .
				</p>

				<p>
					Log file information is stored for a maximum of 7 days for security
					reasons (e.g. to investigate misuse or fraud) and then deleted. Data
					whose further storage is required for evidence purposes are excluded
					from deletion until the respective incident has been finally
					clarified.
				</p>

				<h4>Online presence in social media</h4>
				<p>
					We maintain online presences within social networks and platforms in
					order to be able to communicate with the customers, interested parties
					and users active there and to be able to inform them about our
					services there.
				</p>

				<p>
					We would like to point out that user data can be processed outside of
					the European Union. This can result in risks for the user because, for
					example, the enforcement of the user&apos;s rights could be made more
					difficult. With regard to US providers who are certified under the
					Privacy Shield, we would like to point out that they undertake to
					comply with the data protection standards of the EU.
				</p>

				<p>
					Furthermore, user data is usually processed for market research and
					advertising purposes. For example, usage profiles can be created from
					usage behavior and the resulting interests of users. The usage
					profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements
					inside and outside the platforms that presumably correspond to the
					interests of the user. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored
					on the users&apos; computers, in which the usage behavior and the
					interests of the users are stored. Furthermore, data can also be
					stored in the usage profiles independently of the devices used by the
					users (especially if the users are members of the respective platforms
					and are logged in to them).
				</p>

				<p>
					The processing of the personal data of the users takes place on the
					basis of our legitimate interests in effective information of the
					users and communication with the users in accordance with Article 6
					Paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR. If the users are asked by the respective
					providers to consent to the data processing (i.e. declare their
					consent, for example by ticking a check box or confirming a button),
					the legal basis for the processing is Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter a.,
					Article 7 GDPR.
				</p>

				<p>
					For a detailed description of the respective processing and the
					possibility of objection (opt-out), we refer to the following linked
					information from the providers.
				</p>

				<p>
					Also in the case of requests for information and the assertion of user
					rights, we would like to point out that these can be asserted most
					effectively with the providers. Only the providers have access to the
					data of the users and can take appropriate measures and provide
					information directly. If you still need help, you can contact us.
